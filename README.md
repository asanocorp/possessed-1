the game is in s very early stage of development and at the moment i'm only gathering together materials and graphical elements which might inspire some of the artwork that eventually will end up as part of the game.

with this in mind i would like to take a look at the description again this time with links to some references which might tell you more than my explanations ever could/would or most probably will be (unless we have a better writer tnam me that is).

possessed with fire is an impertinent and volatile synthesis of [modern web tech](http://goo.gl/5e9f0); intoxicated with primitive game mechanics and [heavy acid techno](http://goo.gl/p1Glpv); then set on a mathematically defined collision course with dynamic and razor-edged [scalable vector graphics](http://goo.gl/Zf9BBh)
