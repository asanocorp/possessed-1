not so (a) pure CSS animation with

(b) sprite animation with svg plus

(c) svg animation with smil

so in short there is nothings pure here in any way what-so-ever and in fact you have here a mash-up of several compositions and quite randomly found techniques

---

in greater detail this experiment combines number of techniques and bits of script i encountered researching svg graphics and animation.

to be even more specific:

(a) is [Muybridge horserace ](http://codepen.io/shawnmcburnie/pen/HJpEI/) by [ Shawn McBurnie](http://codepen.io/shawnmcburnie)

>Pure CSS animation. Classic Muybridge images used for horse gallop cycle; layering/parallax directly inspired by Rachel Nabors' cat Tuna;

which itself is a clone of someone elses code ... i don't know ... i guess i'm done with referencing here;

(b) which was a starting point of this exploration originated from [markusT](https://github.com/inkfood) a.k.a. [inkfood](http://www.inkfood.com/) and the original source code could be found on  
https://github.com/inkfood/dump_2014/tree/master/sriteAnimationDemo

hacked together in a trully zombie manner by [![me](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/s.cdpn.io/73058/possessed.svg)](http://codepen.io/rafszul/) with added for the hell of it my own

(c) [Look Ma, no CSS nor JS!!!](http://codepen.io/rafszul/details/bNERPL/) which boasted

> SVG animation with SMIL - no css, no js, 100% pure 206 lines of xml

and which at some point will become the player sprite
